# env
Example environment files for various sites.

Copy one of these files to the repo root so you can modify and activate it at your convenience:
```console
$ cp env/perlmutter.sh env.sh
```

To activate:
```console
$ source env.sh
```

Or for short:
```console
$ . env.sh
```

Usually the files in this directory should not be modified, unless one is making a change that all users should have in their environments going forward.
