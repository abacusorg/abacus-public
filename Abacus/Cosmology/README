This is a SWIG wrapper for Abacus' cosmology module.
That means this is a python interface to the same C++ code that Abacus uses.
You will need swig to compile this.

Build this module with
$ make

and import from python as
>>> from Abacus.Cosmology import AbacusCosmo

Here is an example of how to calculate a growth function for a given cosmology with this module:

from Abacus.Cosmology import AbacusCosmo
initial_redshift = 49.
my_cosmology = AbacusCosmo.MyCosmology()
my_cosmology.Omega_m = 0.3
my_cosmology.Omega_K = 0.
my_cosmology.Omega_DE = 0.7
my_cosmology.H0 = 70.
my_cosmology.w0 = -1.
my_cosmology.wa = 0.

cosmology = AbacusCosmo.Cosmology(1./(1+initial_redshift), my_cosmology)
sig8_today = 0.8
sig8_at_z49 = sig8_today * cosmology.current.growth / cosmology.today.growth
