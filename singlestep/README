***Singlestep***
This is the base directory for the singlestep executable. The file singlestep.cpp is the base source file
for compilation. Almost all of the rest of the singlestep codebase is eventually included into
singlestep.cpp durring compilation (as opposed to be compiled seperately and later linked).

We will first give a brief overview of the contents of each subfolder, then descibe the outline of the
program's control flow.


DataModel:
    Storage and layout of problem data in memory.
        -Type definitions for all basic data like position, velocity, cellinfo
        -Memory handling for large datablocks, i.e. *Slabs*
        -General tools for working with Slabdata like Grid, CellInfo

Direct:
    Computation of near-field forces
        -Only for singlestep nearfield computation, not microstepping
