This directory contains simulation configuration directories and a `scripts` directory for the AbacusSummit suite.
The "assembly line" is stored in `scripts`.

The AbacusSummit scripts used to live in `Production/scripts/`, but it seems best to aggregate AbacusSummit-related materials in one directory,
as these are fairly specialized just for AbacusSummit.
