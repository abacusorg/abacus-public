This directory contains the "assembly line" scripts used to run the AbacusSummit simulations.

The `logs` directory is used to store logs from LSF and SLURM job scripts running on summit and rhea.

The AbacusSummit scripts used to live in `Production/scripts/`, but it seems best to aggregate AbacusSummit-related materials in one directory,
as these are fairly specialized just for AbacusSummit.
